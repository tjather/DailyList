# DailyList

**Project Name:** Daily List

**Team Members:** Talha Ather and Jake Davis

**Language Version:** Swift Version 5.6.1, iOS Deployment Target 13.0

**Overview:** This app will be a todo list app. This app allows us to add new todo lists that users can custom name. These lists can then be selected and items can be added to each individual list. These items can be checked off and deleted when they are completed. There will also be search functionality within the app that will populate all the items on the list that contain the word that was searched for.

**Functionality Requirements:** To run our application, one must use XCode, which is available on macOS for download online or on the app store. Additionally, two packages also need to be downloaded. To download these, perform `pod 'RealmSwift'` and `pod 'SwipeCellKit'`.
